# Coffee machine app
If all the smart coffee machines share the same, or almost same, thing description, then their affordances to interact with them are the same. 
In this case it's possible to create an app that talk with different smart coffee machine, also if they are created by different vendors. 

This is a react web app in order to interact with a selected smart coffee.

It's important that at least one coffee machine is running in order to communicate with it, obviously :)

## Run it
`npm install` to install all the modules

`npm start` to start application

Open a browser on http://localhost:3000/ in order to view and use the app.
